\section*{Overview}\label{overview}

In this supplement, we present the details of the pre-processing of
ProMED and HealthMap feeds \ref{sec:data-cleaning}, 
the model results using ProMED,
HealthMap and WHO data and the impact of the datasources and model
parameters on the performance of the model. We varied the length of the
time window used for model fitting (see Methods for details). SI Sections
2, SI Section 3 and SI Section 4 present the forecasts using ProMED,
HealthMap and WHO data respectively using different calibration windows (2, 4
and 6 weeks) and forecast horizons (4, 6 and 8 weeks). The calibration window
did not have a strong influence on the model performance (SI Figure 28).
Similarly, the data used also did not influence the model performance
(SI Figure 29). We explored the impact of alternate priors for the
gravity model parameter on the results from the model. The results of
this sensitivity analysis are presented in SI Section 7. We present
additional analysis on the predicting the spatial spread of the
epidemic in Section~\ref{sec:spatial-spread}.


\section{Data cleaning}\label{sec:data-cleaning}

The data from ProMED and HealthMap was pre-processed to remove
inconsistencies and address missing data (see Methods). The data on
cumulative number of confirmed and suspected Ebola cases in Guinea,
Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Mali, Nigeria and Ghana were extracted
from ProMED and HealthMap feeds. The pre-processing workflow is 
illustrated using data for Sierra Leone from ProMED.

  \caption{Illustration of workflow for Processing ProMED feed.
    Raw ProMED feed consisted of suspected and confirmed
    cases and suspected and confirmed
    deaths. The top left figure (a) shows the suspected (blue) and
    confirmed (red) cases in Sierra Leone in the raw feed.
    We used the suspected and confirmed cases to derive cumulative
    incidence data (b). Duplicate alerts on a day were then removed
    by assigning the median of the cases reported to this day.
    (c).
    If there were outliers in the data, we removed them in the next step (d).
    We then made the cumulative case count monotonically increasing (e) by
    removing inconsistent records. Finally, missing data was imputed using
    log-linear interpolation (f). Imputed points are show in light blue.
    See Methods for details.}

\subsection{Weekly incidence from ProMED, HealthMap and WHO data}

We processed the data from ProMED and HealthMap and derived daily and
weekly incidence. The weekly incidence series derived from the three
data sources were highly correlated.

  \caption{Comparison of national weekly incidene trends from ProMED (blue),
    HealthMap (green) and WHO (yellow) data for Guinea, Liberia and
    Sierra Leone. Weeks for which all daily data points were imputed
    are shown in lighter shades of blue and green respectively. The
y-axis differs for each plot.}
\label{fig:weekly}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Correlation between R estimates}\label{correlation-between-r-estimates}

The correlation between estimates of time-varying reproduction number 
estimated using ProMED, HealthMap and WHO data depended on the
time window used for estimation and the country.

    ProMED, HealthMap and WHO data. The reporduction numbers were
    estimated using R package EpiEstim over a 2, 4 or 6 week sliding
    window. Median estimates from WHO data are on the x-axis and the
    median estimates using ProMED (blue) and HealthMap (green) data
    are on the y-axis. All correlation coefficients were statistically
  significant.}

    constant over the forecast horizon. If the 97.5th percentile of the R
    estimate used for forecasting was less than 1, we defined the epidemic
    to be in the declining phase during this period. Similarly, if the 2.5th
    percentile of R was greater than 1, we defined the epidemic to be in a
    growing phase. The phase was set to neither where the 95\% Credible
    Interval of the R estimates contained 1.}

    incidence, and reproduction number estimates from ProMED data.
    The top panel shows the weekly incidence derived from ProMED
    data and 6 weeks incidence forecast on log scale.
    The solid dots represent the observed weekly incidence where
    the light blue dots show
    weeks for which at least one data point was obtained using
    interpolation. The forecasts are made over 6 week windows, based on the
    reproduction number estimated in the previous 2 weeks.
    The middle figure in each panel shows the reproduction number
    used to make projections over each 4 week forecast horizon.
    The bottom figure shows the effective reproduction number estimated
    retrospectively using the full dataset up to the length of one time window before the end.
    In each case, the solid gray line is the median
    estimate and the shaded region represents the 95% Credible Interval.
    The red horizontal dashed line indicates the $R_t = 1$ threshold.
    Results are shown for the three mainly affected countries although the
    analysis was done using data for all countries on African mainland.
    All figures in Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Supplementary material follow
    the same layout and color convention. }

For the results presented in the main text, we choose an uninformative

then fitted the model with a uniform prior for \(\gamma\) allowing it to
vary from 1 to 10. In this section we present the results from the
sensitivity analyses. Although the analysis was carried out for the
three data sources (ProMED, HealthMap and WHO), for brevity we present
results using ProMED data only.

  \caption{Estimates of mobility model
  parameters during the epidemic. Population movement was modelled using a
  gravity model where the flow between locations \(i\) and \(j\) is
  proportional to the product of their populations and inversely
  population to the distance between them raised to an exponent \(gamma\).
  The parameter gamma thus modulates the influence of distance on the
  population flow. Here \(\gamma\) is allowed to vary between 1 and 10.
  \(p_{stay}\) represents the probability of an individual to stay in a
  given location during their infectious period. The solid lines
  represents the median estimates obtained using ProMED data. The shaded
  regions represent the 95\% CrI.}
