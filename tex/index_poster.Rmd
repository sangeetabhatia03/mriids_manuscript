# Introduction

### Motivation

`R bookdown` [@R-bookdown] is an excellent R [@R-base] package for authoring books on programming languages. It has the potential to do much more than authoring R books if users costumize self-defined templates. However, the development of templates is difficult and unnecessary. Therefore I developed `bookdown+` [@R-bdp].

### Features

`R bookdown+` is a collection of multiple templates. With `bookdown+` you can easily

- write a laboratory journal, or a personal diary,
- draw a monthly or weekly or conference calendar,
- record guitar chords,
- write a mail in an elegant layout,
- and, of course, write academic articles in your favourite way,
- with chemical molecular formulae and equations,
- even in Chinese,
- and more wonders will come soon.

This poster you are viewing now is produced by `R bookdown+`.

# Quick start

Before starting, you have to install R, RStudio, bookdown package, and other software and packages (\ie `Pandoc`, \LaTeX, `rmarkdown`, `rticle`, `knitr`, etc.) which bookdown depends on. See the official manual of bookdown ^[https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/] for details.

[Download `bookdown+`](https://github.com/dapengde/bookdown-plus/archive/master.zip) ^[https://github.com/dapengde/bookdown-plus] package as a zip file from Github. Unzip it to a folder in your PC. Double click a file named `_start.Rproj`, which will be opened by RStudio.

Open `_runme.R` and run it. The explanation is as follows,

1. Specify the title and the author of your book or document.
2. Choose a template out of the available templates. Run `fun/build.R`.
3. Press `ctrl+shift+b` to build a demo book, which you can find in `book/`. Write your own text in `body.Rmd`, and build your own lovely book. 

# Graphs

Using `bookdown` or `rmarkdown`, users can insert figures into a document in a friendly way. Just embed the R scripts into your `.Rmd` file(s) and compile it/them with knitr package, and the figures will appear automatically with high resolution and reproductivity.

<!--

```{r co2, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap='Carbon dioxide concentration, observed at Mauna Loa.'}
plot(co2)
```

-->

```{r iris, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='IRIS data plotted with R ggplot2 package.'}
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = Species)) +
    facet_wrap(~ Species)
```

<!-- Comments -->


# Table

Similarly to graphs, tables can be inserted either with R script or with markdown syntax.

<!--

header x  header y
--------- ----------
x1        y1
x2        y2

-->

```{r tab1, tidy=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(iris, 3), caption = 'IRIS data as an example.',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

# Take-home message

- `R bookdown+` is an extension of `bookdown` for academic and literal writing, especially for reproducible reports.

- `R bookdown+` is still being developed. Feel free to join me either in contributing templates to [**my Github repo**](https://github.com/dapengde/bookdown-plus) ^[https://github.com/dapengde/bookdown-plus], or in writing the tutorial of R bookdown+ [@R-bdp].
