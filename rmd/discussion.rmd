# Discussion

In the context of increasing threat of movement of
diseases between various regions of the world due to increased global 
connectivity, innovative disease surveillance  solutions are urgently 
needed. We compared the West African Ebola outbreak of 
2014-2016 digital surveillance data from 
ProMED/HealthMap curated by the moderators at ProMED/HealthMap with
the data collated by the WHO and made available at the end of the 
epidemic.

In general, we found the data from ProMED and HealthMap to be in good 
agreement with the data collated by WHO through traditional 
surveillance methods. In particular, retrospective estimates of 
transmissibility over time were highly correlated across all data 
sources. As future incidence trends are more sensitive to the accuracy of 
transmissibility estimates than to the accuracy of incidence estimates,
the observed agreement in transmissibility estimated from the
different data sources suggests that digital surveillance data 
could be used for providing accurate trends for forecast in an outbreak.
  
In spite of the manual curation of the 
data carried out by subject matter experts at ProMED and HealthMap, 
significant quality issues remained in the data feeds. Dealing with 
issues such as missing information and inconsistent records was a key 
challenge in using these data. 

In spite of these challenges, we 
argue that digital surveillance tools can play a very important role
in early detection of outbreaks. Particularly in an evolving outbreak 
scenario, when information
from traditional surveillance is limited and available with a 
significant delay, digital surveillance data can be used to
complement the information gap. Development of tools that can
be plugged into the current digital surveillance ecosystem should
therefore be an area of focus. At the same time, since the West
African Ebola outbreak was unprecedented in extent and scope, it is 
important to further investigate the reliability of digital
surveillance methods and data using other outbreaks.

We used the ProMED/HealthMap data to perform a spatiotemporal analysis 
of the spread of the outbreak. We fitted a spatially 
explicit branching process model to the daily incidence data derived 
from  ProMED/HealthMap feeds. The estimated parameters were used to 
simulate the outbreak trajectory over 4, 6 and 8 weeks. 
The model performs well
at short projection horizon. At longer time scale (more than 2 weeks 
in this instance), the model performance begins to deteriorate.
A possible explanation for this could be that we assume that the
transmissibility remains constant over
the entire projection window. This assumption may not hold as we move 
project over longer horizons for instance, due to interventions being
implemented. Model performance also depended on the phase of the 
epidemic in which projections were made. During a growing phase, the 
model tended to over-predict while in a declining phase, there was a 
tendency to under-predict. This variation could have important 
implications if the model predictions are used to inform resource
allocation. Model estimates should therefore be interpreted with caution, 
particularly as an outbreak is observed to be declining. 

For the West African Ebola epidemic, ProMED and HealthMap data were 
available at a coarse spatial scale with the district level
information for cases missing in most of the records. This 
limited our analysis to the spread of the outbreak across 
national borders only, although our model implementation allows
for consumption of data at any spatial scale. It would be 
interesting to explore ways of integrating spatially coarse 
but timely data from ProMED and HealthMap with spatially resolved 
but delayed data from ground surveillance.

The framework presented in this paper was developed as a proof of 
concept to use digital surveillance data for near real time
forecasting of the course of an outbreak. To further develop this
system, it is important to establish an automated pipeline from data 
collection to curation to analysis, which currently requires manual 
intervention at each of these steps. Another factor that could enhance
the usability of the system in near real time is to improve the
running time of the
fitting and forward simulation. In the current implementation, the
running time varies from up to 30 mins with projection being done 
for example, with 100 days of data to more than a day when an year of 
incidence data are used. Although the West African Ebola epidemic was 
of unusual duration, there is a significant scope for optimising 
the model implementation.
