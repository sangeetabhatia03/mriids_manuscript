In the context of increasing threat of inadvertent movement of
diseases between various regions of the world due to increased global 
connectivity, innovative disease surveillance  solutions are urgently 
needed. We compared the West African Ebola outbreak of 
2014-2016 digital surveillance data from 
ProMED/HealthMap curated by the moderators at ProMED/HealthMap with
the data collated by the WHO and made available at the end of the 
epidemic.

In general, we found the data from ProMED and HealthMap to be in good 
agreement with the data collated by WHO through traditional 
surveillance methods. However, in spite of the manual curation of the 
data carried out by subject matter experts at ProMED and HealthMap, 
significant data 
quality issues remained in the data feeds. Dealing with issues such as 
missing data and inconsistent data records was a key challenge
in using these data. 

In spite of these challenges, we 
argue that digital surveillance tools can play a very important role
in early detection of outbreaks. Particularly in an evolving outbreak 
scenario, when information
from traditional surveillance is limited and available with a 
significant delay, digital surveillance data can be used to
complement the information gap. Development of tools that can
be plugged into the current digital surveillance ecosystem should
therefore be an area of focus. At the same time, since the West
African Ebola outbreak was unprecedented in extent and scope, it is 
important to further investigate the reliability of digital
surveillance methods and data using other outbreaks.

We used the ProMED/HealthMap data to perform a spatiotemporal analysis 
of the spread of the outbreak. We fitted a spatially 
explicit branching process model to the daily incidence data derived 
from  ProMED/HealthMap feeds. The estimated parameters were used to 
simulate the outbreak trajectory over 4, 6 and 8 weeks. 
The model performs well
at short projection horizon. At longer time scale (more than 2 weeks 
in this instance), the model performance begins to deteriorate.
A possible explanation for this could be that we assume that the
transmissibility remains constant over
the entire projection window. This assumption may not hold as we move 
project over longer horizons for instance, due to interventions being
implemented. 

For this outbreak, ProMED and HealthMap data were 
available at a coarse spatial scale with the district level
information for cases missing in most of the records. This 
limited our analysis to the spread of the outbreak across 
national borders only, although our model implementation allows
for consumption of data at any spatial scale. It would be 
interesting to explore ways of integrating spatially coarse 
but timely data from ProMED and HealthMap with spatially resolved 
but delayed data from ground surveillance.
