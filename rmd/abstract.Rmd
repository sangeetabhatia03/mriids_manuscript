  In our increasingly interconnected world, it is crucial to
  understand the risk of an outbreak originating in one country/region
  and  spreading to the rest of the world. Rapid recognition and
  response to potential pandemics and emerging diseases have become
  essential global health priorities. Digital disease surveillance
  tools such as ProMed and HealthMap have the potential to serve as
  important early warning systems as well as complement the field
  surveillance data during an ongoing outbreak. While there are a
  number of systems that carry out digital disease surveillance, there
  is as yet a lack of tools that can compile and analyse the generated
  data to produce easily understood actionable reports. We present a 
  flexible statistical model that uses different streams
  of data (such as disease surveillance data, mobility data etc.) for
  short-term incidence trend forecasting.  
  In validating the model using data collected by ProMED and
  HealthMap during the 2014-2016 West African Ebola outbreak,
  we provide a realistic appraisal of the strengths and limitations
  of such data in incidence forecasting.
  We infer incidence trends at finer spatial scales from
  aggregated data. Our work shows how the data from
  event based surveillance systems (EBS) can complement the data
  collected from traditional public health infrastructure. During an
  ongoing crisis, combining data from different sources gives
  stakeholders a more complete picture.
