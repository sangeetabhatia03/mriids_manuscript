  In our increasingly interconnected world, it is crucial to
  understand the risk of an outbreak originating in one country or region
  and  spreading to the rest of the world. Digital disease surveillance
  tools such as ProMED and HealthMap have the potential to serve as
  important early warning systems as well as complement the field
  surveillance data during an ongoing outbreak. Here we present a 
  flexible statistical model that uses data produced from digital
  surveillance tools (ProMED and HealthMap) to forecast short term 
  incidence trend in a spatially explicit manner. The model was  
  validated using data collected by ProMED and
  HealthMap during the 2014-2016 West African Ebola epidemic
  providing a realistic appraisal of the strengths and limitations
  of using such data for incidence forecasting. Our approach 
  should allow to forecast the risk of spatial spread of 
  future outbreaks in near real-time, based on publicly available 
  data.
