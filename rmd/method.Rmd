# Methodology
The underlying model relies on a well-established and simple framework 
that assumes the daily incidence, \(ùêº_t \) , can be approximated with a
Poisson process following the renewal equation
[@fraser2007estimating]. 

\[
  I_{j, t} \sim 
  Pois
  \left( 
    R_t \sum_{s = 1}^{t}{I_{t - s}\omega_s}
  \right).
\]

Here \(R_t\) is the reproduction number at time \(t\) and \(\omega\)
is the distribution of the serial interval. 

We build on this model to incorporate the spatial spread of the
outbreak. 
Let \(1, 2, \dots, n\) be \( n \) different locations.
The number of cases at a location \(j\) at time \(t\) is given by the equation
\[
  I_{j, t} \sim 
  Pois\left( 
  \sum_{i = 1}^{n} 
  {\left( p_{i \rightarrow j}
  R_{i, t} \sum_{s = 1}^{t}{I_{i, t - s} w_{s}}
  \right)} 
  \right),
\]

where \(R_{i, t}\) is the reproduction number at location \(i\) at time
\(t\) and \(p_{i \rightarrow j}\) is the probability of moving from
location \(i\) to location \(j\). $R_{t, i}$ is
affected by a number of other factors e.g., the intrinsic
transmissibility of a pathogen, the health care capacity at location
$i$ etc. The model can be easily extended to incorporate the
dependence of the reproduction number on these factors. 

The probability of moving between locations is derived from the
relative flow of populations.
This latter quantity is estimated using a population flow
model such as a gravity model \citep{GROSCHE2007175}. 
Under a gravity model, the flow of individuals from area \(i\) to area \(j\),
\(\phi_{i \rightarrow j}\), is proportional to the product of the
populations of the two areas, \(N_i\) and \(N_j\) and inversely
proportional to the distance between them \(d_{i, j}\), all quantities
are raised to some power.
\[
  \phi_{i \rightarrow j} :=  \frac{N_i^{\alpha}N_j^{\beta}}{d_{i, j}^{\gamma}}.
\]
In practice, \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are assumed to be $1$. The
exponent \( \gamma \) modulates the effects distance on the flow of
populations. A large value of \( \gamma \) indicates that the
distances travelled by populations tend to be short.

The relative risk of spread at a location \(j\) from a location \(i\)
is thus the population flow into location \(j\) from location \(i\).

\[
  r_{i \rightarrow j}^{spread} = \frac{\phi_{i \rightarrow
  j}}{\sum_{x}{\phi_{i \rightarrow
  j}}}.
\]

The probability of movement from location \(i\) to location \(j\) is given by
\[  p_{i \rightarrow j} = (1 - p_{stay}^i) r_{i \rightarrow j}^{spread},\]

where \(p_{stay}^i\) is the probability of staying at location
\(i\). As the above equation indicates, by varying $p_{stay}^i$, we
can capture the dynamics of population flow across spatial units. For
instance, if \(p_{stay}^i\) is large, then the flow out of location
\(i\) would be small. Thus, if this parameter is geographically
heterogeneous, we obtain imbalanced flow of population (i.e. a source-sink dynamics). 

\subsection{Statistical inference of model parameters}

The parameters of the full model as presented in Section~\ref{sec:model} are: 
\begin{itemize}
\item $R_{t, i}$, the reproduction at time $t$,
\item $p_{stay}$, the probability of staying in location $i$, and 
\item $\gamma$, the exponent of the distance in the gravity model. 
\end{itemize}

The parameters can be estimated using maximum likelihood
estimation or estimating the posterior distribution of the parameters using
MCMC. Let the observed incidence time series at locations \(1\)
through \(n\) and time \(1, 2 \dots t\) be
\[
I = \begin{bmatrix}
    o_{1,1}       & o_{1,2}  & \dots & o_{1,n} \\
    o_{2,1}       & o_{2,2}  & \dots & o_{2,n} \\
    \hdotsfor{4} \\
    o_{t,1}       & o_{t,2}  & \dots & o_{t,n}
\end{bmatrix}
\]
where \(o_{i, j}\) is the observed incidence at time \(i\) at location
\(j\).
Then the likelihood of the model parameters given the
observations is proportional to the probability of the data given
model parameters.  The probability of $o_{j, t}$ given
the model parameters is:
\[ P(o_{j, t} \mid p_{stay}^i, \gamma, R_{i, t}) = e^{-\lambda_{j, t}}
  \frac{o_{j, t}^{\lambda_{j, t}}}{\lambda_{j, t} !}, \]
where $\lambda_{j, t}$ is given by
\[
  \lambda_{j, t} = \sum_{i = 1}^n{\left(p_{i \rightarrow j}R_{i, t} \sum_{s
        = 1}^t{I_{i, s}w_{t - s}} \right)}.\]

Thus assuming that each observation is independent, the likelihood of the parameters is proportional to
\[
\mathcal{L} = P(\{o_{j, t}\} \mid \{p_{stay}^i\}, \gamma, \{R_{i, t}\}) = 
 \prod_{t = 1}^{t}{e^{-\lambda_{i, t}} \frac{o_{i, t}^{\lambda_{i, t}}}{\lambda_{i, t} !}}.
\]
In practice, we estimate $R_{t, i}$ as an average over the past 2 or 3 week with sliding time windows.

Given this likelihood, we can write the joint posterior distribution of the parameter given the observed data as:

\[
P( \{p_{stay}^i\}, \gamma, \{R_{i, t}\} \mid \{o_{j, t}\}) \propto  
  \mathcal{L} \times P(\{R_{i,0}\}) P(\{p_{stay}^i\}) P(\gamma).
\]

Here, $P(\{R_{i,0}\})$ represents the prior distribution of the basic reproduction number. This prior distribution is 
influenced by data-stream 2 and the health capacity of the location $i$, as described above.

The other prior distributions,  $P(\{p_{stay}^i\})$ and $P(\gamma)$, could in principle reflect the influence of 
additional data sources such as prior information derived from flight data.
