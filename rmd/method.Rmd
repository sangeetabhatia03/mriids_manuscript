## Statistical model
Our model relies on a well-established and simple framework 
that assumes the daily incidence, \(ùêº_t \) , can be approximated with a
Poisson process following the renewal equation
[@fraser2007estimating]. 

\[
  I_{t} \sim 
  Pois
  \left( 
    R_t \sum_{s = 1}^{t}{I_{t - s}\omega_s}
  \right).
\]

Here \(R_t\) is the reproduction number at time \(t\) (the average 
number of secondary cases per infected individual) and \(\omega\)
is the distribution of the serial interval (the time between onset of 
symptoms in a case and their infector).

We extend this model to incorporate the spatial spread of the
outbreak between  \( n \) different locations.
The number of incident cases at a location \(j\) at time \(t\) is
given by the equation
\begin{align}
  I_{j, t} \sim 
  Pois\left( 
  \sum_{i = 1}^{n} 
  {\left( p_{i \rightarrow j}
  R_{i, t} \sum_{s = 1}^{t}{I_{i, t - s} \omega_{s}}
  \right)} 
  \right),
  (\#eq:likelihood)
\end{align}

where \(R_{i, t}\) is the reproduction number at location \(i\) at time
\(t\) and \(p_{i \rightarrow j}\) is the probability of moving from
location \(i\) to location \(j\). $R_{i, t}$ is
affected by a number of factors e.g., the intrinsic
transmissibility of a pathogen or the health care capacity at location
$i$ (which could influence the capacity to isolate cases). 
The model can be easily extended to explicitly incorporate the
dependence of the reproduction number on these factors. 

The probability of moving between locations is derived from the
relative flow of populations between locations.
This latter quantity can be estimated using a population flow
model; here we used a gravity model \citep{GROSCHE2007175}. 
Under a gravity model, the flow of individuals from area \(i\) to area \(j\),
\(\phi_{i \rightarrow j}\), is proportional to the product of the
populations of the two locations, \(N_i\) and \(N_j\) and inversely
proportional to the distance between them \(d_{i, j}\), all quantities
are raised to some power.
\[
  \phi_{i \rightarrow j} =  \frac{N_i^{\alpha}N_j^{\beta}}{d_{i, j}^{\gamma}}.
\]
 The exponent $\gamma$ modulates the effect of distance on the flow of
populations. A large value of $\gamma$ indicates that the
distances travelled by populations tend to be short.

The relative risk of spread at a location \(j\) from a location \(i\)
is thus the population flow into location \(j\) from location \(i\).

\[
  r_{i \rightarrow j}^{spread} = \frac{\phi_{i \rightarrow
  j}}{\sum_{x}{\phi_{i \rightarrow
  x}}}.
\]

The probability of movement from location \(i\) to location \(j\) is 
then given by
\[  p_{i \rightarrow j} = (1 - p_{stay}^i) r_{i \rightarrow j}^{spread},\]

where $p_{stay}^i$ is the probability of staying at location
\(i\). 

\subsection{Statistical inference of model parameters}

The parameters of the full model are: 

1.  \(R_{i, t}\), the reproduction number at time \(t\) in location \(i\),
2.  \(p_{stay}^i\), the probability of staying in location \(i\), and 
3.  \(\gamma\), the exponent of the distance in the gravity model. 

For simplicity, and in the absence of data to inform these, 
we assumed the exponents \(\alpha \) and \(\beta\) on the
populations to be 1. The serial interval was assumed to be gamma 
distributed with parameters taken from the literature [@team2015west].

We used a Bayesian approach, and sampled from the joint posterior
distribution of all parameters  using Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC). The likelihood of the
incidence at time \(t\) in location \(j\) given past incidence across all 
locations and model parameters is, as in equation \@ref(#eq:likelihood): 

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} 
P(I_{j, t} \mid & p_{stay}, \gamma, \omega \\
& R_{1, t}, R_{2, t}, \dots , R_{n,t}, \\ 
& I_{1, 1}, I_{1, 2} \dots I_{1, t}, \\
& I_{2, 1}, I_{2, 2} \dots I_{2, t}, \\
& I_{n, 1}, I_{n, 2} \dots I_{n, t}) = 
e^{-\lambda_{j, t}}
  \frac{I_{j, t}^{\lambda_{j, t}}}{\lambda_{j, t} !}, 
\end{aligned}    
\end{equation}

where $\lambda_{j, t}$ is given by

\begin{equation}
\lambda_{j, t} = \sum_{i = 1}^n{\left(p_{i \rightarrow j}R_{i, t} \sum_{s
        = 1}^t{I_{i, t - s} \omega_{s}} \right)}.
(\#eq:lambdajt)		
\end{equation}

Thus the likelihood of the parameters is proportional to

\[\mathcal{L} = P(\{I_{j, t}\} \mid p_{stay}, \gamma, \{R_{i, t}\}) = 
 \prod_{t = 1}^{t}{e^{-\lambda_{i, t}} 
 \frac{I_{i, t}^{\lambda_{i, t}}}{\lambda_{i, t} !}}.\]

Therefore the joint posterior distribution of the model parameters 
given the observed data is:

\[P(\{p_{stay}^i\}, \gamma, \{R_{i, t}\} 
   \mid 
   \{I_{j, t}\}) 
   \propto  
   \mathcal{L} \times P(\{R_{i,t}\}) P(\{p_{stay}^i\}) P(\gamma).\]

\(P(\{p_{stay}^i\})\),  \(P(\gamma)\), and \(P(\{R_{i, t}\})\) 
represent the prior distributions on the parameters. The influence of
factors such as healthcare capacity of a location can be incorporated
into the model through the prior distribution of the reproduction
numbers. 
Similarly, the prior
distributions on the probability of staying at a location and the
exponent on distance could be informed by additional data sources 
such as prior information derived from human migration data (e.g., 
census data). 

Here, we have assumed a single \(p_{stay}\) for all 
countries on African mainland. For estimating the time-varying
reproduction number for each country, we split the duration of the
total outbreak into intervals of equal width. We assume that
transmissibility in each location stays constant within each time 
window and thus,
within a time window, we estimated  a single reproduction number for
each location. We varied the length of this
time window to obtain different models, with short time windows 
increasing
the number of parameters in the model.


We assumed a Gamma distributed serial interval with mean 14.2 
days and standard deviation 9.6 days [@team2015west]. 
For the reproduction number, we used a Gamma prior with mean 
3.3 and variance 1.5. This was informed by a review of 
estimates of the reproduction number for Ebola Zaire in 
outbreaks preceding the West African Ebola outbreak which 
reported estimates ranging from 1.4 to 4.7 [@van2015review]. 
The mean prior 3.3 was chosen as the midpoint of this interval, 
and the variance 1.5, was chosen so the 95% prior probability
interval contains the extremes of this interval.

For gravity model parameters $p_{stay}$ and $\gamma$, we 
choose uninformative uniform priors. 
Since $p_{stay}$ is a probability
the prior was a uniform distribution on the interval \([0, 1]\).
$\gamma$ was allowed to vary between 1 and 3.

Model fitting was done in a Bayesian framework using MCMC
methods as implemented in the software Stan [@carpenter2017stan] 
and its R interface rstan [@rstan]. For projecting the incidence
beginning at day \(t\), we fitted the model to the daily
incidence series derived from ProMED/HealthMap data up to day
\( t - 1\). Transmissibility was assumed to stay constant in the
time frame over which we were projecting. Samples from the 
posterior distribution for the effective reproduction
number estimated in the last time window before the point of
projection were used for projections. Similarly samples from the
posterior distribution for $ \gamma $ and $ p_{stay} $ were
used to estimate the relative flow.
