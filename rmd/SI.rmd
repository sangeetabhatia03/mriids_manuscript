# Data Pre-processing 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("ms-figures/r_corr_time_window.png")
```


## Impact of the time window on the estimation of R 

The correlation between transmissibility estimates from ProMED,
HealthMap and WHO data was strongly influenced by the choice of the 
time window.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = rcorrcap, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("ms-figures/r_corr_time_window.png")
```

## Projections over alternative time windows for inference
### Projections using 4 weeks for estimating R
#### 4 weeks Projection window 
#### 8 weeks Projection window 
### Projections using 6 weeks for estimating R
#### 4 weeks Projection window 
#### 8 weeks Projection window
