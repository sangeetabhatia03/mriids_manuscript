## Cleaning ProMED/HealthMap data feeds

The data cleaning consists of the following steps : extracting the
total case counts as a sum of desired case categories, merging
duplicate alerts, removing data that made the cumulative case counts 
inconsistent and finally, fill in the missing data using
interpolation. Results at each step pre-processing workflow for Sierra
Leone are show in Figure \@ref(fig:hmclean).
