# Processing ProMED/HealthMap data feed

We used a set of curated ProMED and HealthMap records on the human 
cases of Ebola in West Africa. 
The dates in the feeds ranged from March 2014 to October 2016.
The data set recorded the cumulative number of suspected/confirmed
cases and suspected/confirmed deaths by country at various dates
in this period. We derived the country specific daily and 
weekly incidence time series from these data after the 
following data cleaning and pre-processing:

+ We first extracted the total case
counts as a sum of suspected and confirmed cases. 
+ Each unique record 
in ProMED/HealthMap data is associated with a unique alert id.  Where
multiple records were associated with the same alert id, we merged
them by assigning the median of the case numbers to the record. In
some instances, cumulative case count was inconsistent in that it
failed to be monotonically increasing. Any record of a 
cumulative case number lower than a previous record was removed.
+ Finally, cumulative incidence on days with no records was
filled in using linear or log-linear interpolation. 

Further details and result of 
each step of the pre-processing of Promed and 
Healthmap data are presented in the supplementary text.



## Comparison of incidence trends from different sources

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
incidrcite <- fig_nums(name = "incidrcompare",
                       display = "cite")
incidrcap <- fig_nums(name = "incidrcompare",
                      caption = "Comparison of daily incidence
trends and R estimates from ProMED, HealthMap and WHO data (A) Daily
incidence series derived from ProMED, HealthMap and WHO data. The

time-varying reproduction number estimated using the WHO data are shown
on the x-axis and the corresponding estimates from ProMED (blue) and

```

We compared the processed country-specific incidence time 
series derived  from ProMED and HealthMap
data with the incidence data collated by WHO during the West 
African Ebola epidemic  made available by [@garske20160308], 
later referred to as ``the WHO data'' in the interest of brevity. 
Incidence time series and the reproduction numbers estimated using the
incidence from these various sources are shown in  
`r incidrcite` for the three mainly affected 
countries: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.  The instantaneous 
reproduction number was estimated independently for each country in
using the R package EpiEstim [@cori2013new] with a time window of 
6 weeks.


The weekly incidence time series derived from ProMED and HealthMap data are 
highly correlated with the WHO incidence data (Pearson's correlation
coefficient 0.44 and 0.74 respectively, p value < 0.001). The digital 
surveillance data differ significantly from the WHO data at the peak 
of the epidemic approximately in the first few months of 2015. While 
the reasons for this discrepancy are not entirely clear, they could 
for instance reflect the susceptibility of digital surveillance to
biases in reporting. At the same time, it is important to remember
that the WHO data used here are an extensively cleaned
version of the data collected during the epidemic [@who2014ebola, 
@team2015west], published well after the epidemic was declared to be 
over. During the epidemic, the first situation report by the WHO 
was published only at the
end of August 2014 [@whositrep], reporting on cases between January 
and August 2014. On the other hand, the first post
on ProMED on Ebola cases in Guinea appeared in March 2014
[@pmfirstebola]

```

The estimates of the reproduction number are strongly influenced by
the choice of the time window (`r rcorrcite`). 
The correlation between mean R
estimates from ProMED or HealthMap data with the estimates from WHO
data varied from weak (0.13, time window of 2 weeks) to very strong 
(0.90, time window of 6 weeks).

## Short term projections

To project incidence at time \(t\), we used the incidence data up to 
day \(t - 1\). To estimate the time-varying reproduction number for 
each country, we divided the duration from day 1 to day \( t - 1 \) 
into time windows of equal width. 
Assuming that transmissibility in each location stays constant 
within each time window, we estimated 
a single reproduction number for each location. 
We varied the length of this time window from 1 week to 4 weeks 
to obtain different models. The forecast horizon was varied from
4 weeks to 8 weeks. 

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
g28cite <- fig_nums(name = "promed28",
                    display = "cite")

who28cite <- fig_nums(name = "who28",
                      display = "cite")

```
`r g28cite` shows the
non-overlapping weekly forecasts from ProMED data 
for 4 weeks for Guinea, Liberia and 
Sierra Leone respectively. The length of the
time window used for estimating reproduction number is 4 weeks.
The forecasts using WHO data are shown in `r who28cite`.
In both the figures, the top panel shows the projected weekly 
incidence overlaid on the observed weekly incidence. 
The figure in the middle shows the posterior distribution of the 
reproduction number used for projection in the corresponding time
frame. 
This estimate uses only data available up to the point at which the
projection is made. The last figure in each panel
shows the reproduction number estimated using all available data up 
to the end.

Results from the model using other time windows and projection horizon 
are presented in the supplementary text.

g28cap <- fig_nums(name = "promed28",

```
`r parscite` shows how the estimated values of 
the parameters of the mobility model changed over the course of
the outbreak. Both these parameters were assumed to be constant
for the time frame over which model was fitted and across all
countries.

```

It is interesting to note that the change in estimates over the course 
of the epidemic suggests a decreased probability of 
travel across national borders.

## Evaluation of the model performance

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
assesscite <- fig_nums(name = "assess", display = "cite")
assesscap <- fig_nums(name = "assess",
                      caption = "Metrics for evaluating model
performance where the projection horizon was 4 weeks.
The y-axis shows (anti-clockwise from top left)
bias, log relative accuracy, relative mean
absolute error and sharpness scores respectively. In the forward
projections, we assumed transmissibility to be constant over the
projection window. be If the 97.5th percentile of the R estimate used
was less than 1, we defined the epidemic to be in the declining phase
during this period. Similarly, if the 2.5th percentile of R was
greater than 1, we defined the epidemic to be in a growing phase.")
```
Figure `r assesscite` shows the metrics (bias,
sharpness, log of relative accuracy, and relative mean absolute error) 
discussed earlier for the 4 week projections in 
Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia using a 4-week window to estimate
reproduction number. Each metric was first computed using the daily
observed and predicted series and then averaged across all weeks of
projections.

Across all metrics, there is a strong trend of decreased model
performance as the forecast horizon increases. The bias in forecasts
at week 1 is closer to 0 at every time point. Similarly the forecasts
at week 1 are more sharp (sharpness close to 0) than at week 4. In
general, the model performs better in the growing phase of the
epidemic (defined as the window in which the 0.025th percentile of the
posterior distribution of the reproduction number is greater than 1). 
In this phase, the
forecasts are generally greater than the observed incidence while in 
the declining phase (defined similarly as the window in which the 
0.975th R percentile is less than 1), the model tends to 
under-predict. The
length of the calibration window did not have a significant impact on 
the model performance.
