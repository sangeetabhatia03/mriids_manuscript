## Comparison of incidence trends from different sources

Incidence time series were computed from ProMED, HealthMap and WHO
data (see Methods section) for the three mainly affected countries, 
Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and are shown in 
`r incidrcite`. The raw and processed (see Methods) data from ProMED 
and HealthMap for all countries included in the feed are available as
supplementary material. 
There were substantial differences between the incidence 
time series derived from the three data sources, particularly at the 
peak of the epidemic. There may be multiple reasons underpinning such
discrepancy, including potential variability in digital surveillance 
reporting to during the course of the epidemic. It is also worth 
highlighting that the WHO data used here are an extensively cleaned 
version of the data collected during the epidemic [@who2014ebola], 
[@team2015west], published more than a year after the epidemic was declared to be 
over. However, despite these discrepancies, the weekly incidence
derived from ProMED and HealthMap was moderately to highly correlated 
with that reported by WHO later (Pearson's 
correlation coefficient aggregated across the three countries 
0.44 and 0.74 respectively, p value < 0.001).

To broadly assess the extent to which such discrepancies in incidence 
would impact the quantification of transmissibility throughout the 
epidemic, we estimated the time-varying transmissibility, measured by 
the reproduction number $R_t$ (the average number of secondary cases 
infected by each individual infected at time $t$),
using the incidence from each of the three data sources 
`r incidrcite`. 
$R_t$ was estimated independently for each country using 
the R package EpiEstim [@cori2013new] with a sliding time window of 4
weeks. There were substantial differences in the estimates of the $R_t$ 
according to the incidence data source used (Figure 1B). 
The correlation between the mean R estimates on sliding 4-week windows 
from ProMED or HealthMap data with the estimates from WHO data varied 
from weak (0.27, between reproduction number from WHO and ProMED in 
Guinea ) to very strong (0.81, between reproduction number from WHO
and HealthMap in Sierra Leone).

In the following, we use ProMED data as our main data source, 
unless otherwise specified. 


## Short term projections

To project incidence at time $t$ in location $j$ ($I_{j, t}$), 
we fitted a spatially explicit branching process model to the daily
incidence in all locations up to 
$t - 1$, using an extension of the renewal equation as the likelihood 
[@fraser2007estimating]:

\begin{equation}
I_{j, t} \sim Poisson\left(\sum_{i = 1}^n\left({p_{i \rightarrow j} R_{i, t}
\sum_{s = 1}^t{I_{i, t - s} \omega_s}}\right)\right)
(\#eq:model)
\end{equation}

where the matrix $p_{i \rightarrow j}$ characterises the spatial
spread between locations $i$ and $j$ based on a gravity model
[@zipf1946p]. $R_{i, t}$ (the reproduction number) reflects 
transmissibility in location $i$ at time $t$, and $\omega$ is the
typical infectiousness profile of a case over time after infection 
(see Methods for details).


The ability of the model to robustly predict future outbreak
trajectory depended on the 
data source (see `r g28cap` for forcasts using ProMED data and 
SI Figures 2, 3 and 4  for HealthMap and WHO data 
respectively) as well as on  the time window used for inference and 
the time horizon used for predictions (alternative time window in
SI.XX). Overall, using a 2-week time window for inference based on 
ProMED data, and projecting ahead for 4 weeks, 62.75% of observed 
incidence across all three countries in the forecast horizon were included 
in the 95% forecast intervals.  Using data from Healthmap and 
WHO respectively, this figure was 62.75% and 73.5%.

As expected, the robustness of forecasts decreased over the 
forecast horizon (`r assesscite`). In the first week of the forecast
window, 73.1% of observed values (across the three countries) were 
within the 95% forecasts interval. The mean value of the relative mean 
absolute error (see Methods for details) in the first week of the
forecast horizon was 1.21 
(Inter Quartile Range, IQR: 0.18 - 0.69), suggesting that on average 
our central one 
week ahead predictions were about a third off either way of the 
observations. To further assess the potential tendency of our model 
to systematically under or over predict observations, we used a bias 
measure ranging from -1 for a model which always under-predicts, to 
1 for a model which always over-predicts (see Methods). 
The mean bias for one-week ahead projections was 0.05 (IQR -0.25 -
0.4) indicating little systematic bias. 

The uncertainty associated with the forecasts (which can be measured 
by the sharpness, i.e. the 
deviation from the median, see Methods for details) is also an important 
indicator of model performance. The mean sharpness in the first week
of the projetion window is 2.6 (IQR 0 - 3.57) meaning that on average
our individual projected one-week ahead epidemic trajectories are 2 
cases away from the median projection.

In the second, third and fourth weeks of the projection window, the 
percentage of observed values within the 95% forecasts interval 
were  65.2%,  58.5% and 
54.6% respectively. Similarly, the mean relative error increases up to 
7.35 (IQR 0.25 - 2.15) in week 4, the mean bias up to 0.08 (IQR -0.53 -
0.94) and the mean sharpness up to 11.83 (IQR 0 - 5.89).


We examined whether the model performance varied depending on the
country and the phase of the epidemic, defined as "growing" 
when the 97.5th percentile of the posterior distribution of $R_t$ is
above 1, "declining" when the 97.5th percentile of the posterior 
distribution of $R_t$ is less than 1, and "neither" in all other 
cases. In general, the model performance was better in the declining 
phase of the epidemic than in the growing phase, with 50% of the 
observations contained in the 95% forecasts interval 
`r proptabcite`. The bias scores (`r assesscite` A) 
indicate that in the growing phase, the model tends to over-predict 
with the forecasts becoming less sharp (`r assesscite` B)  as 
forecasts are made over longer time frames. In the declining phase on 
the other hand, the model tends to under-predict but forecasts are 
generally sharper.

Fitting the model with alternative time windows (2, 4 or 6 weeks) 
modifies the model complexity as the number of non-overlapping time 
windows, and thus parameters, over the course of the epidemic
increases with shorter time windows. An analysis of models using 
different window sizes, showed in XXXX suggested that overall, the 
length of the time window used to estimate $R_t$ did not have a
significant impact on the model performance. We also found that while 
in the late phase of the epidemic, there was decisive support for 
smaller time window, in the early phase, we did not find strong 
evidence for using a smaller time window.


In addition to measuring how well our model predicted the future 
incidence in the three mainly affected country, we examined whether 
it was able to accurately predict the presence/absence of cases in 
other countries. We found that our approach allowed to robustly
predict the presence or absence of cases in all countries up to a week 
in advance in many cases (`r alertscite`).  Assuming that an alert is
raised based the 97.5th percentile of the forecasts, we 
classified an alert for a given week as either a true alert (if both 
the observed and projected incidence in that week were non-zero), 
a false alert (if the forecasted incidence is non-zero observed 
incidence was zero), or a missed alert (if observed incidence was non 
zero but the projected incidence was zero).  We chose to base the
alert on the upper limit of the 95% forecasts interval to maximise 
sensitivity, i.e. minimise the number of missed alerts. In several 
instances, a single false alert or a string of false alerts is
followed by a true alert 
suggesting that the model is able to capture and even anticipate the 
spatial spread of the epidemic. For instance, in July 2014, a false 
alert is raised in Nigeria and cases are in fact observed in Nigeria
in the following week.

In addition to providing operational outputs such as the predicted s
hort term incidence in currently affected countries or the risk of 
spread to neighbouring countries, our method also provides near
real-time estimates of parameters underlying the transmission model. 
First, the reproduction number $R_t$ for each affected country is 
estimated over the time-window of inference, here over the most recent 
two weeks (`r g28cite`, second row). We found that these near
real-time estimates of $R_t$ were in good agreement with retrospective 
estimates obtained using the entire incidence time-series (`r g28cite`, 
bottom row, correlation coefficients varying between 0.93 and 0.99).

The risk of spatial spread in our model relies on estimating movement 
pattern of infectious cases. Our method also provides estimates of the 
parameters of the underlying gravity model (see Methods), $p_{stay}$, 
the probability of a case staying within a country throughout their 
infectious period, and $\gamma$, a measure of the extent to which
distance between two locations affects the flow between them. 
The real-time estimates of these two parameters over the course of 
the epidemic, shown in `r parscite`,suggest that while the relative flow 
between locations did not vary substantially over time, the
probability of travel across national borders may have decreased after 
the initial phase of the epidemic. `r parscite` also illustrates how 
accumulating data throughout the course of the epidemic allows 
estimating such parameters more precisely.
