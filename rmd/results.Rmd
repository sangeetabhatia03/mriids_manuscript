# Results

The raw data from ProMED is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:hmraw)

```{r hmraw, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Raw data from HealthMap", fig.align = "center"}

```


## Cleaning ProMED/HealthMap data feeds

The data cleaning consists of the following steps : extracting the
total case counts as a sum of desired case categories, merging
duplicate alerts, removing data that made the cumulative case counts 
inconsistent and finally, fill in the missing data using
interpolation. Results at each step pre-processing workflow for Guinea
are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:hmclean).

## Comparison of incidence trends from different sources

We compare incidence trends derived from ProMED and HealthMap as well
as data from WHO. The results are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:incidcompare)

```{r incidcompare, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Comparison of daily incidence trends derived from ProMED, HealthMap and WHO data. The three time series exhibit a high degree of correlation.", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/who_promed_hm_incid.png")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:rcompare) compares the reproduction number estimated 
from the respective incidence series. As expected, the estimated
reproduction number are highly correlated.


```{r rcompare, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Comparison of daily incidence trends derived from ProMED, HealthMap and WHO data. The three time series exhibit a high degree of correlation.", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/who_promed_hm_r.png")
```


## Short term projections

Figures \@(fig:guinea49, fig:liberia49, fig:sl49) show the weekly forecasts
for 4 weeks from the point of projection. Reproduction number is
estimated for each 7 week window upto the point of projection. The 
reproduction number in the window immediately preceding the point of
projection is used for forecasting and is assumed to be constant
during the forecasting window. Each figure shows
projections done at two points - one in the increasing and one in the
declining phase of the epidemic. 


```{r guinea49, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Data clean-up steps", fig.align = "center"}

```


```{r liberia49, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Data clean-up steps", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Liberia_98_245_49_28.png")
```


```{r sl49, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Data clean-up steps", fig.align = "center"}

```


We experimented with different window lengths for estimating R. 
Figures \@(fig:guinea7, fig:liberia7, fig:sl7) show the forecasts for 
the time points for a time window of 1 week.
