# Introduction
Increasing globalization of 
commerce, finance, production, and services
has fostered rapid global movement of people, animals, plants, 
food, and feed [@morse2001factors]. With the transportation
of people and goods comes the widespread dispersion of pathogens 
that cause infectious diseases and
the vectors that may spread them. Outbreaks that 
begin in the most remote parts of the world now
spread swiftly to urban centers in countries far 
away with dangerous, global consequences[@ex1995communicable]. 
A powerful example of the rapid spread of outbreaks 
was the s evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 
2002-2004 that originated 
in Guangdong province in China and reached as far 
as Toronoto, Canada, primarily through travellers [@whosars].
A more recent example is the current yellow outbreak fever in 
Angola. Infected travellers from Angola are arriving in China  
representing the first ever reported cases of yellow fever in Asia
[@wasserman2016yellow].


Early detection of infectious disease outbreaks can help public 
health officials to initiate intervention such as 
removing contaminated food sources, isolating affected 
individuals or vaccination campaigns. Thus early identification 
of an outbreak can potentially limit its size and
prevent an outbreak from becoming a pandemic. Digital 
surveillance tools can play a significant role 
in the rapid recognition of public health emergencies
[@grein2000rumors, @anema2014digital]. 

The Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases 
(ProMED, www.promedmail.org) was 
one of the first entrants in the field of digital 
disease detection. ProMED was started in 1994 as a surveillance
network to provide early warning of familiar as well as emerging 
infections [@morse2012public]. ProMED now provides free email 
based reports on outbreaks to over 70,000 subscribers in at 
least 185 countries. 

HealthMap (www.healthmap.org) is another widely used 
tool for disease outbreak monitoring. 
In addition to ProMED alerts, HealthMap utilises online news 
aggregators, eyewitness reports and other formal and informal
sources of information and allows for visualisation of alerts 
on a map. 

With the dizzying growth of the internet, there have been a 
corresponding growth in tools for internet based digital 
disease detection. Examples include 
MediSys (http://medisys.newsbrief.eu/), H5N1 Google Earth mashup
(www.nature.com/avianflu/google-earth), Emerging Infections 
Network (http://ein.idsociety.org) and others.

However, gathering timely data, while critical, is but the first 
step in the disease surveillance process. Compiling the data, 
conducting analysis, and generating actionable reports that are 
easily understood are equally important. For instance, the 
spread of Zika to the Americas was predicted and reported on 
in March 2014 by one of the subject matter experts at the 
Program on Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) [@promedzika], 
well before the
epidemic surfaced in South America in February 2015.
However, lacking an easy to use and openly accessible 
visualization of the risk, this information did not have any 
significant impact on public health resource allocation and 
decision making.
While there has been a
growth in the number of digital surveillance tools as well as  
epidemiological studies using data from these 
tools [@chowell2016elucidating], there is as yet a dearth of a
framework that can automatically combine various streams of  
information to produce actionable reports, particularly in real time 
during an outbreak where such information would be most useful.

other tools that do similar stuff - EpiDMS [@liu2016epidms]



To address this gap, we have developed 
a system to estimate and visualize risks posed by
outbreak events. At the heart of the system is a simple methodological
framework that integrates multiple data streams to
quantify spatial heterogeneity in the risk of disease spread and
estimate, for a given country, where the risk comes from. 
In this paper, we present the model implemented in this system and as
a case study, we report the analysis of  ProMED/HealthMap data for the 2014 West 
African Ebola outbreak.

Our work makes two key contributions. First, in using only  
data available through ProMED/HealthMap to analyse this outbreak, we 
provide a realistic appraisal of their strengths and weaknesses,
especially if used in near real-time forecasting. Second, we 
suggest a method to combine ground and digital surveillance 
data to estimate a relatively more complete picture of the 
spread of an outbreak. As other authors have emphasised, digital
disease detection is not a replacement for, but complementary to
public health infrastructure. Our work underscores how the two 
can be used in conjunction with each other to better inform 
stakeholders.
