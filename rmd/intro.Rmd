# Introduction
Pandemics and emerging diseases cause catastrophic morbidity, 
mortality, and economic hardship
and may occur at any time. Increasing globalization of 
commerce, finance, production, and services
has fostered rapid global movement of people, animals, plants, 
food, and feed. With the transportation
of people and goods comes the widespread dispersion of pathogens 
that cause infectious diseases and
the vectors that may spread them. Outbreaks that 
begin in the most remote parts of the world now
spread swiftly to urban centers in countries far 
away with dangerous, global consequences.

Early detection of infectious disease outbreaks has 
the potential to limit the size of an outbreak and
prevent an outbreak from becoming a pandemic. Digital 
surveillance tools have the potential to play a significant role 
in this. They can be used to complement the traditional public
health infrastructure, particularly in resource-poor settings. 
One of the earliest entrants in the field of digital surveillance 
is The Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED). ProMED 
was founded in 1994 with the goal of detecting emerging infectious 
or toxin-mediated diseases through emails from clinicians, experts 
and freely dissemiate contextualsied and curated information.

HealthMap is another key player in the field of internet based 
surveillance. In addition to using curated ProMED reports, 
Healthmap utilises other informal sources such as online news 
and eyewitness reports.

However, gathering timely data, while critical, is but the first 
step in the disease surveillance process. Compiling the data, 
conducting analysis, and generating actionable reports that are 
easily understood are equally important. While there has been a
proliferation of digital surveillance tools as well as  
epidemiological studies using data from these 
tools [@chowell2016elucidating], there is as yet a dearth of a
framework that can automatically combine various streams of  
information to produce actionable reports, particularly during an 
outbreak where such information would be most useful.

slightly old paper - authors curated news themselves!

To address this gap, the International Society for Infectious 
Diseases (ISID) through its
program ProMED along with project partners the Imperial College 
London, HealthMap, and HealthSites.io, have developed 
a system to estimate and visualize risks posed by
outbreak events. The system integrated multiple data streams. 
In this paper, we present the model implemented in this system. 
We analyse ProMED data for the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak.
Our work makes two key contributions. First, in using only  
data available through ProMED to analyse this outbreak, we 
provide a realistic appraisal of its strengths and weaknesses,
especially is used in near real-time forecasting. Second, we 
suggest a method to combine ground and digital surveillance 
data to estimate a relatively more complete picture of the 
spread of an outbreak. As other authors have emphasised, digital
disease detection is not a replacement for, but complementary to
public health infrastructure. Our work underscores how the two 
can be used in conjunction with each other to better inform 
stakeholders.
