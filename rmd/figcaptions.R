(A) Daily incidence derived from ProMED (blue), HealthMap (green) and WHO data (orange).
Daily incidence that was not directly available from ProMED and HealthMap data and
which were therefore imputed (see Methods) are shown in lighter shade of blue and green respectively.
WHO data were aggregated to country level. The y-axis differs for each plot. (B)
The mean time-varying reproduction number

The shaded regions depicts the 95% credible intervals (95% CrI) for the $R_t$ estimates.
The reproduction number was estimated on sliding windows of 28 days, using the  EpiEstim R
package with a time window of 28 days. Estimates shown at time $t$ are for
the 28-day window finishing on day t.")

The top panel shows the weekly incidence derived from ProMED

The solid dots represent the observed weekly incidence where
the light blue dots show
weeks for which at least one data point was obtained using
interpolation. The projections are made over 4 week windows, based on the
reproduction number estimated in the previous 2 weeks.
The middle figure in each panel shows the reproduction number
used to make projections over each 4 week forecast horizon.
The bottom figure shows the effective reproduction number estimated
retrospectively using the full dataset up to the end.
In each case, the solid gray line is the median
estimate and the shaded region represents the 95% Credible Interval.
The red horizontal dashed line indicates the $R_t = 1$ threshold.
Results are shown for the three mainly affected countries although the
analysis was done using data for all countries on African mainland.")

to be constant over the forecast horizon. If the 97.5th percentile of the R estimate used
for forecasting was less than 1, we defined the epidemic to be in the declining phase
during this period. Similarly, if the 2.5th percentile of R was
greater than 1, we defined the epidemic to be in a growing phase. The phase was
set to neither where the 95% Credible Interval of the R estimates contained 1.")

The panel on the left shows the True and False alert rates using different
thresholds for classification. For a given threshold ($x^{th}$ percentile of the
forecast interval), we defined a True alert for a week where the $x^{th}$ percentile of the
the forecast interval and the observed incidence for a
country were both greater than 0; false alert for a week where the threshold
for a country was greater than 0 but the observed incidence
for that country was 0; and missed alert: week where the threshold for a country was 0 but the
observed incidence for that country was greater than 0. True alert rate is the fraction of correctly
classified true alerts (i.e., (true alerts)/(true alerts + missed alerts).
False alert rate is similarly the fraction of correctly classified false alerts.
The right panel shows
the True (green), False (yellow) and Missed (red) alerts using the 97.5th percentile of
the forecast interval as threshold. The figure only shows countries on the African continent for which either the
predicted incidence or the observed incidence was greater than 0 at least once.
For each country, four rows are shown,
corresponding to the 1, 2, 3 and 4 week ahead predictions respectively.
Country codes, shown on the y-axis, are as follows: BEN - Benin, BFA -
Burkina Faso, CIV - CÃ´te d'Ivoire, CMR - Cameroon, COD - Democratic
Republic of Congo, GIN - Guinea, GNB - Guinea-Bissau, LBR - Liberia,
MLI - Mali, NER - Niger, NGA - Nigeria, SEN - Senegal, SLE - Sierra
Leone, TGO - Togo. Predictions used here are using the ProMED
data, a 2-week window for inference and a 4 week forecast horizon.")
