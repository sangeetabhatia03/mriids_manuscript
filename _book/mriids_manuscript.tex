\maketitle

In our increasingly interconnected world, it is crucial to understand
the risk of an outbreak originating in one country/region and spreading
to the rest of the world. Rapid recognition and response to potential
pandemics and emerging diseases have become essential global health
priorities. Digital disease surveillance tools such as ProMed and
HealthMap have the potential to serve as important early warning systems
as well as complement the field surveillance data during an ongoing
outbreak. While there are a number of systems that carry out digital
disease surveillance, there is as yet a lack of tools that can compile
and analyse the generated data to produce easily understood actionable
reports. We present a flexible statistical model that uses different
streams of data (such as disease surveillance data, mobility data etc.)
for short-term incidence trend forecasting.\\
In validating the model using data collected by ProMED and HealthMap
during the 2014-2016 West African Ebola outbreak, we provide a realistic
appraisal of the strengths and limitations of such data in incidence
forecasting. We infer incidence trends at finer spatial scales from
aggregated data. Our work shows how the data from event based
surveillance systems (EBS) can complement the data collected from
traditional public health infrastructure. During an ongoing crisis,
combining data from different sources gives stakeholders a more complete
picture.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Pandemics and emerging diseases cause catastrophic morbidity, mortality,
and economic hardship and may occur at any time. Increasing
globalization of commerce, finance, production, and services has
fostered rapid global movement of people, animals, plants, food, and
feed. With the transportation of people and goods comes the widespread
dispersion of pathogens that cause infectious diseases and the vectors
that may spread them. Outbreaks that begin in the most remote parts of
the world now spread swiftly to urban centers in countries far away with
dangerous, global consequences.

Early detection of infectious disease outbreaks has the potential to
limit the size of an outbreak and prevent an outbreak from becoming a
pandemic. Digital surveillance tools have the potential to play a
significant role in this. They can be used to complement the traditional
public health infrastructure, particularly in resource-poor settings.
One of the earliest entrants in the field of digital surveillance is The
Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED). ProMED was founded in
1994 with the goal of detecting emerging infectious or toxin-mediated
diseases through emails from clinicians, experts and freely dissemiate
contextualsied and curated information.

HealthMap is another key player in the field of internet based
surveillance. In addition to using curated ProMED reports, Healthmap
utilises other informal sources such as online news and eyewitness
reports.

However, gathering timely data, while critical, is but the first step in
the disease surveillance process. Compiling the data, conducting
analysis, and generating actionable reports that are easily understood
are equally important. While there has been a proliferation of digital
surveillance tools as well as\\
epidemiological studies using data from these tools
\citep{chowell2016elucidating}, there is as yet a dearth of a framework
that can automatically combine various streams of\\
information to produce actionable reports, particularly during an
outbreak where such information would be most useful.

other tools that do similar stuff - EpiDMS \citep{liu2016epidms}
slightly old paper - authors curated news themselves!
\citep{chowell2016elucidating}

To address this gap, the International Society for Infectious Diseases
(ISID) through its program ProMED along with project partners the
Imperial College London, HealthMap, and HealthSites.io, have developed a
system to estimate and visualize risks posed by outbreak events. The
system integrated multiple data streams. In this paper, we present the
model implemented in this system. We analyse ProMED data for the 2014
West African Ebola outbreak. Our work makes two key contributions.
First, in using only\\
data available through ProMED to analyse this outbreak, we provide a
realistic appraisal of its strengths and weaknesses, especially is used
in near real-time forecasting. Second, we suggest a method to combine
ground and digital surveillance data to estimate a relatively more
complete picture of the spread of an outbreak. As other authors have
emphasised, digital disease detection is not a replacement for, but
complementary to public health infrastructure. Our work underscores how
the two can be used in conjunction with each other to better inform
stakeholders.

\section{Results}\label{results}

The raw data from ProMED is shown in Figure \ref{fig:hmraw}

\subsection{Cleaning ProMED/HealthMap data
feeds}\label{cleaning-promedhealthmap-data-feeds}

The data cleaning consists of the following steps : extracting the total
case counts as a sum of desired case categories, merging duplicate
alerts, removing data that made the cumulative case counts inconsistent
and finally, fill in the missing data using interpolation. Results at
each step pre-processing workflow for Guinea are shown in Figure
\ref{fig:hmclean}.

\subsection{Comparison of incidence trends from different
sources}\label{comparison-of-incidence-trends-from-different-sources}

We compare incidence trends derived from ProMED and HealthMap as well as
data from WHO. The results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:incidcompare}

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:rcompare} compares the reproduction number estimated
from the respective incidence series. As expected, the estimated
reproduction number are highly correlated.
