# Data Pre-processing 

```{r}

```


## Impact of the time window on the estimation of R 

The correlation between transmissibility estimates from ProMED,
HealthMap and WHO data was strongly influenced by the choice of the 
time window.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "R estimates are strongly influenced by the time window used for inference.", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("si-figures/r_corr_time_window.png")
```

## Projections over alternative time windows for inference
### Projections using 4 weeks for estimating R
#### 4 weeks projection window 


```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Projections using ProMED data with 4 weeks window for inference and projections made over 6 weeks.", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("si-figures/promed_28_42.png")
```


```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Projections using ProMED data with 4 weeks window for inference and projections made over 8 weeks.", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("si-figures/promed_28_56.png")
```

#### 8 weeks projection window 
### Projections using 6 weeks for estimating R
#### 4 weeks projection window
